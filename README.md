- ⚡ Fun fact: PSR&C is a family owned company which was founded in 2009 whose sole owner is Phillip J Sutherland. Our highly trained staff is fully qualified for the installation of tile, shingle, coatings, flat and various other roofing systems. However, we never believe one has reached the pinnacle of their roofing education, therefore we provide continued education and safety training to all of our employees.
